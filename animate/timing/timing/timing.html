            <h2>Inanimate Objects</h2>
            <p>Inanimate objects move <b>predictably</b> under known forces. For example, an object falls with an
                acceleration of ~9.8m p/s</p>
            <ul>
                <li> 1/8 second - 0.08m - 3 frames</li>
                <li> 1/4 second - 0.3m - 6 frames</li>
                <li> 1/2 second - 1.2m - 12 frames</li>
                <li> 1 second - 4.9m - 24 frames</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Slow Actions</h2>
            <p>The closers the animation drawings are to each, the slower the movement appears.</p>
            <p>Slower movement are harder to animate effectively due to the nature of the animation medium. Productions tend to use live action for this instead.</p>
            <p>Ω Why difficult? Hard for animator to get the level of precision require for every small inch of movement in each muscle</p> 
            <p> Alternatively animators can use fades and motion blues for similar effects </p>
            <p>The closers the animation drawings are to each, the slower the movement appears.</p>
            <p>Ω How does anime solve this problem?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Fast Actions</h2>
            <p>Easier to animate compared to slow actions. Strength of the animation medium as you can exaggerate and add pace and energy in drawings for effectively than in real life actions</p>
            <p>Audience <b>must</b> be able to read whats happening through the fast sequence. Make as readable as neccesary.</p>
