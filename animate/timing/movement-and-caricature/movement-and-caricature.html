        <p>This can be used on the extremities of an object e.g. a tail, hat, coat, clothing fringes etc. They appear to
            move semi-independently compared to the main character. However they are influenced by
        <ul>
            <li>The action of the character</li>
            <li>The weight and flexibility of the object</li>
            <li>Air resistance</li>
        </ul>
            i.e. external forces
