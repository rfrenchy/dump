        <section>
            <h2>Inanimate Objects</h2>
            <p>Inanimate objects move <b>predictably</b> under known forces. For example, an object falls with an
                acceleration of ~9.8m p/s</p>
            <ul>
                <li> 1/8 second - 0.08m - 3 frames</li>
                <li> 1/4 second - 0.3m - 6 frames</li>
                <li> 1/2 second - 1.2m - 12 frames</li>
                <li> 1 second - 4.9m - 24 frames</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Buoyancy</h3>

            <h2>Slow Actions</h2>
            <p>The closers the animation drawings are to each, the slower the movement appears.</p>
            <p>Slower movement are harder to animate effectively due to the nature of the animation medium. Productions
                tend to use live action for this instead.</p>
            <p>立 Why difficult? Hard for animator to get the level of precision require for every small inch of movement
                in each muscle</p>
            <p> Alternatively animators can use fades and motion blues for similar effects </p>
            <p>The closers the animation drawings are to each, the slower the movement appears.</p>
            <p>立 How does anime solve this problem?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Fast Actions</h2>
            <p>Easier to animate compared to slow actions. Strength of the animation medium as you can exaggerate and
                add pace and energy in drawings for effectively than in real life actions</p>
            <p>Audience <b>must</b> be able to read whats happening through the fast sequence. Make as readable as
                neccesary.</p>

            <h2>Timing to suggest Weight and Force</h2>
            <q>Each part of the body moves as a result of the action of the muscles, or as a result of the movement
                of another part of the body.</q>

                <p>立 How to maintain correctly sized volumes across the animation?</p>

                <p><i>think walk cycles?</i></p>
            </section>
            <p>立 How is this anything to do specifically with timing, rather than anatomy? The position of the poses on
                the frame and the type of pose drawn?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Cycles</h2>
            <h3>How long to repeat?</h3>
            <p><q>The cycle is failure when/if the audience realises it is a cycle</q></p>
            <p>An animator can use cycles smartly to disguide this and avoid this fact.</p>
            <p>Different object and repeats require a different touch for each depending on their nature.</p>
