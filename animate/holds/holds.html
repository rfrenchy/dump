            <h2>In-and-out of Holds</h2>
            <p>A character can hold a <b>balanced</b> looking pose forever, even if portraying strained emotions such as
                tension or anguish. Not true for the inverse, you cannot hold an unbalanced, awkward, extreme pose for
                too long without it looking awkward pictorially. Instead they are used for framing in-and-out of poses.
            </p>
            <p>Ω No extreme too extreme? How far can you push boundaries for a given character/scene/picture?</p>
            <p>Hold drawings should work well on their own i.e. you shouldn't need a series of drawings for it to look
                right. The opposite is true of an action, which only look right as part of a series of drawings i.e. an
                animation</p>
            <p>Ω <i>Avoid balance in action sequences</i></p>
            <p>Long holds are more believable in graphic and stylised characters and objects. This is because the more
                abstract nature of it means the audience has to use their imagination to fill in the gaps.</p>
            <p>With realistic figures, you have to use <i>moving holds</i>, otherwise it will look <i>frozen</i>. For
                example, a figure has to blink every 3/5 seconds, has to shift weight one foot to another etc.</p>
            <p> Ω There are lots of <b>known</b> variations and timings for actions and holds.</p>
